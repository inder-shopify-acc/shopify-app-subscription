                  My plan can be created in 3 easy to go steps.

                </p>

                <p>

                  <strong>Step1: </strong> Enter the plan name for recognition, this name is just for the app's internal process. To assign the products to the plan click “Select Products”. Here we have given the flexibility to the merchants to either assign the plan to the whole product or to any of the desired variants. Also, the picker has multiple product /variants select options.

                  </figure>

                </p>

                <ol>

                  <li>

                    <strong>Step2: </strong> To add the selling plans in a plan,

                    there are two types: -

                    <ul>

                      <li>

                        <strong> Per Delivery:</strong> In this type, a new order will be created for every delivery by deducting the amount from the user payment gateway automatically.

                        <figure>

                          <img src="<?php echo $image_folder; ?>pay_per_delivery.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />

                        </figure>

                      </li>

                      <li>

                        <strong> Prepaid:</strong> In this type, the User will be charged for future deliveries at single order & then fulfillments need to be processed at the delivery end. For example: - If the billing period is of 30 days & delivery is of every 3 days then at the first order total amount of 10 fulfillments will be deducted and after 10th delivery, the new order will be created automatically for the next 10 deliveries and the cycle will go on until the customer subscription is ended.

                        <figure>

                          <img src="<?php echo $image_folder; ?>prepaid_plan.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />

                      </li>

                    </ul>

                  </li>

                  <li>Selling plans name

                    <ul>

                      <li>

                        Enter the selling plan name for recognition, this name is just for the app's internal process.

                      </li>

                    </ul>

                  </li>

                  <li>Merchant will see the many advance features while creating the selling plans :-

                    <ul>

                        <li>

                          Delivery Period :- The time gap between two order deliveries within the subscription plan. The number should be a minimum of 1, and the timeline can be days/weeks/months/years. For instance, if we have a subscription plan setup for 1 week and the first order is placed today, the next order will be automatically placed exactly after a week. The cycle will continue every week.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          Billing Period :- Billing Period will exist in the prepaid orders. This is the number of deliveries that the customers can pay in advance for. For example, if you set the delivery frequency as 1 week, and if the billing timeframe is 12 weeks, and if , your customers will be charged for 12 weeks, but receive the deliveries once a week, for 12 weeks.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          Minimum number of Cycle :- Minimum number of billing iteration you want to bind your customers with, before they can cancel their subscription. Default value is one (the very first billing iteration).

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          Maximum number of cycle :- Maximum number of billing iteration that will be fulfilled as a part of the subscription plan, after which it will automatically pause. Merchant or customer(If customer has permission by the merchant) can activate or delete the subscription whenever they want.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          Set Order date :- Merchant can set the specific order date, on which the order will be placed. This will show only when the delivery period is in weeks/months/years.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          Cut off Day :- The cutoff indicates how many days in advance the order would need to be placed in order to qualify for the upcoming order cycle.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          Offer Discount :- There are two types of discount Fixed and Percentage.

                          <p>If merchant select the Fixed discount then that fixed amount will be discounted from the product price.</p>

                          <p>If  merchant select the Percentage discount then that percent of the discount will be applied on the product on the product page.</p>

                          <p>Discount will not get disabled or changed if not any recurring discount applied.</p>

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          Recurring Discount :- If recurring discount is enabled then the discount on the subscription product will be changed after the mentioned after cycle. Once the after cycle discount is applied then there is no way to disabled or change the discount. In that case merchant or customer can delete the currenct subscription and can create the new one.

                        </li>

                    </ul>
